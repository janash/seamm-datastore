Description of the flowchart
----------------------------
Step 0: Start  0.6.2

Step 1: Forcefield  0.6.1
    Read the forcefield file 'pcff2018.frc' and use the default forcefield.

Step 2: from SMILES  0.6.2
    Create the structure from the SMILES '[Ar]'

Step 3: Packmol  0.6
    Creating a cubic supercell with a density of 1.0 g/ml containing about 1000
    atoms

Step 4: LAMMPS  0.6

   Step 4.1: Initialization
       Initialize the calculation with a cutoff of 10.0 Å. If the system is
       periodic the best k-space acceleration method for the  molecular system will
       be chosen. The accuracy goal is 1.00E-05.

   Step 4.2: Velocities
       Set the velocities to give a temperature 130.00 K by using a random
       distribution. LAMMPS will remove any translational and, for molecular
       systems, rotational momentum (default).. The random number generator will be
       initialized randomly.

   Step 4.3: NVT dynamics
       100.0 ps of canonical (NVT) dynamics at 130.00 K using a Nose-Hoover
       thermostat. The thermostat will use a drag factor of 0.0.

   Step 4.4: NPT dynamics
       200.0 ps of canonical (NPT) dynamics at 130.00 K using a Nose-Hoover
       thermostat. The thermostat will use a drag factor of 0.0.



Running the flowchart
---------------------
Step 0: Start  0.6.2

Step 1: Forcefield  0.6.1
    Reading the forcefield file 'pcff2018.frc'
    Using the default forcefield 'pcff'.

Step 2: from SMILES  0.6.2
    Create the structure from the SMILES '[Ar]'
    Created a molecular structure with 1 atoms.

Step 3: Packmol  0.6
    Creating a cubic supercell with a density of 1.0 gram / milliliter
    containing about 1000 atoms

    Created a cubic cell 40.481 Å on a side with 1000 molecules for a total of
    1000 atoms in the cell and a density of 1.0 g/ml.

Step 4: LAMMPS  0.6
   LAMMPS using the serial version.

   Step 4.1: Initialization
 
       Setup for a periodic (crystalline or fluid) system. The nonbonded
       interactions will be evaluated using a cutoff of 10.0 Å. Since there are
       no charges on the atoms, no long-range coulomb method will be used. The
       van der Waals terms will be shifted to zero energy at the cutoff
       distance. A long-range correction for the van der Waals terms will be
       added.
 
   Step 4.2: Velocities
       Set the velocities to give a temperature 130.0 K by using a random
       distribution. LAMMPS will remove translational but not rotational momentum.
       The random number generator will be initialized with the seed '634139715'.

 
   Step 4.3: NVT dynamics
       100.0 ps of canonical (NVT) dynamics at 130.0 K using a Nose-Hoover
       thermostat. The thermostat will use a chain of 3 thermostats with 1
       subcycles and a drag factor of 0.0.

 
       The run will be 25,000 steps of dynamics sampled every 25 steps.
