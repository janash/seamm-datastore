   Step 2.1: Optimization
       Step 2.1: Optimization
           Geometry optimization using PM7 and default optimizer (EF for small systems,
           L-BFGS for larger). The geometrical convergence is 1.0 kcal/mol/Å
           kcal/mol/Å. The SCF will be converged to the 'precise' level of 1.0e-06
           kcal/mol


       The geometry optimization converged in 9 iterations to a heat of
       formation of 22.9565 kcal/mol and gradient norm of 0.0385706 kcal/mol/Å.


   Step 2.2: Thermodynamics
       Step 2.2: Thermodynamics
           Thermodynamics calculation using PM7, converged to the 'normal' level of
           1.0e-04 kcal/mol. The thermodynamics functions will be calculated from 200.0
           K to 400.0 K in steps of 10.0 K. 0 lowest modes will be ignored to
           approximately account for 0 internal rotations.


       The geometry converged in 2 iterations to a heat of formation of 22.9565
       kcal/mol.
