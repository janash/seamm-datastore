Description of the flowchart
----------------------------
Step 0: Start  0.6.2

Step 1: from SMILES  0.6.2
    Create the structure from the SMILES 'c1ccccc1'

Step 2: MOPAC  0.1.0

   Step 2.1: Optimization
       Geometry optimization using PM7 and default optimizer (EF for small systems,
       L-BFGS for larger). The geometrical convergence is 1.0 kcal/mol/Å
       kcal/mol/Å. The SCF will be converged to the 'precise' level of 1.0e-06
       kcal/mol

   Step 2.2: Thermodynamics
       Thermodynamics calculation using PM7, converged to the 'normal' level of
       1.0e-04 kcal/mol. The thermodynamics functions will be calculated from 200.0
       K to 400.0 K in steps of 10.0 K. 0 lowest modes will be ignored to
       approximately account for 0 internal rotations.


Step 3: Table  0.6
